## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Restaurant owners face numerous challenges in managing their businesses efficiently, from handling reservations to optimizing operations. To address these challenges, I'm developing a web application aimed at empowering restaurant owners with tools to streamline their management processes.

## Objective <a name="objective"></a>
The primary objective of this project is to build an intuitive interface that enables restaurant owners to effectively manage their reservations. By providing functionalities such as displaying upcoming reservations, filtering, sorting, and searching, the web application aims to enhance the overall efficiency and organization of restaurant operations.

## User Requirements <a name="user-requirements"></a>
As outlined by the product owner, the following user requirements must be addressed in the development of the reservation management interface:

1. **Display the reservations as a list:**
   - Allow users to view upcoming reservations in a clear and organized manner.

2. **Filter reservations:**
   - Enable users to filter reservations based on criteria such as date, status, shift, and area.

3. **Sort reservations:**
   - Provide users with the ability to sort reservations based on different fields to facilitate easy access and organization.

4. **Search by name and surname:**
   - Allow users to search for specific reservations by entering the name and surname of the guest.

## Implementation Approach <a name="implementation-approach"></a>
### Design Inspiration:
The initial phase involved seeking design inspiration from various sources to conceptualize the layout and visual elements of the reservation management interface. This process aimed to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface that meets modern design standards.

### Prototype Creation:
Drawing from the design inspiration gathered, I proceeded to craft a prototype of the reservation management feature. This prototype served as a blueprint for the interface layout, interactions, and overall user experience, providing a clear direction for development.

### Technology Stack:
In selecting the technology stack, I opted for `Next.js` framework (recommended by React). Additionally, I utilized `shacn/ui` for styling components, ensuring consistency and responsiveness across different screen sizes. To effectively manage tabular data, `Tanstack` was incorporated, offering robust solutions for organizing and displaying reservation information.

### Development Process:
The development process was conducted with a focus on modular and scalable code architecture. I adopted agile methodologies to iteratively build and test features, ensuring rapid progress and adaptability to changes throughout the development cycle.

### Deployment and Maintenance:
Upon successful implementation and testing, the project was deployed to [vercel](https://booking-lab-three.vercel.app/).

## New Feature Proposal: Real-Time Timeline View <a name="new-feature-proposal"></a>
In addition to the existing features, I propose a real-time timeline view for upcoming reservations. This feature will provide users with a visual representation of reservation schedules, including countdowns for guest arrivals and a list of non-confirmed guests for quick confirmation or rearrangement.

### Key Components:
1. **Countdown for Guest Arrival:** Display the remaining time for each upcoming reservation, enabling users to anticipate guest arrivals more effectively.
  
2. **List of Non-Confirmed Guests:** Showcase a list of reservations that are pending confirmation, allowing users to promptly confirm them or rearrange their placement on the timeline.

## Enhancements to Existing Features: <a name="enhancements-to-existing-features"></a>
To further improve user experience and streamline reservation management, enhancements will be made to the existing reservation management page.

### Direct Status Change in Table:
Users will have the ability to change the status of reservations directly within the table interface. A pop-up selection will offer only the next possible steps, simplifying the process and reducing user effort.

### Flow Management:
Empower users to manage the flow of reservations more efficiently by providing tools to customize and optimize the reservation process. This could include features such as reordering reservations, adjusting time slots, and setting preferences for automatic status updates based on specific criteria.
